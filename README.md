# Rambolimanager

RamboliManager is a comprehensive application designed to streamline the management of two essential websites for the Ramboli Talents Association. The first website, rambolitalents.daniel-monteiro.fr, serves as a central hub for the association, offering features such as product management (ticketing and rentals), workshops, and even the ability to scan sold tickets during events. The application enables administrators of this site to efficiently manage products and events while providing a user-friendly experience for members and visitors.

Furthermore, RamboliManager also plans to support a second website, membre.rambolitalents.daniel-monteiro.fr, which will serve as a cloud for association members. This section, currently in development, will offer members the ability to change their passwords, contribute to the content of the cloud, create accounts, and send emails to other association members. This will enhance communication and collaboration within the association while providing a centralized space for resource and information sharing.

In a forward-looking perspective, RamboliManager also has plans to implement an accounting module that will allow the association to manage its finances transparently and efficiently.

In summary, RamboliManager is a versatile application aimed at simplifying management and collaboration within the Ramboli Talents Association, providing powerful tools to manage websites, members, accounting, and much more.
